## 1. Video Presentation

## 2. Project Summary

### 1. Device Description

Apathy is a model space rover that aims to capture the considerances of space agencies when sending rovers to other planets. Our project was inspired by the team members' mutual interest for space technologies and desire to understand how various components interact to produce an autonomous information-collecting machine.

### 2. Device Functionality

Our PCBA consists of a multitude of sensing components such as a GPS for latitude/longitude coordinates, an IMU for tilt detection, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a solar cell as part of a larger solar tracking mechanism. It also facilitates a stepper motor and servo motor for actuation of the solar cell.

Explain how your Internet-connected device is designed
Include sensors, actuators, and other critical components.
Include your system-level block diagram here.

### 3. Challenges

Our team faced difficulties towards the later stages of the project when bringing up the board and writing firmware for each onboard IC.

Where did you face difficulties? This could be in firmware, hardware, software, integration, etc.
How did you overcome these challenges?

### 4. Prototype Learnings
What lessons did you learn by building and testing this prototype?
What would you do differently if you had to build this device again?

### 5. Next Steps & Takeaways
What steps are needed to finish or improve this project?
What did you learn in ESE5160 through the lectures, assignments, and this course-long prototyping project?

## 3. Hardware & Software Requirements

## 4. Project Photos & Screenshots
